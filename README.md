# ☁️ Cloud-Native Banking System

A fully **cloud-native microservices system** demonstrating modern **DevOps practices**, **CI/CD pipelines**, **containerization**, **observability**, and **analytics** on AWS using **Docker, EKS, Terraform**, and monitoring tools.  

This project simulates a banking platform with multiple services, providing hands-on experience with cloud infrastructure, automation, and operational practices.

---

## 🏗️ Project Overview

This project simulates a **cloud-native banking platform** with the following microservices:

- **Accounts Service** – Manages bank accounts and balances  
- **Auth Service** – Handles user authentication and authorization  
- **Notifications Service** – Sends alerts and updates to users  
- **Transactions Service** – Processes deposits, withdrawals, and transfers  

The system demonstrates **end-to-end DevOps and cloud practices**, from infrastructure provisioning to deployment, monitoring, and analytics.

## 📚 Key Learnings & Reflections
- CI/CD pipelines rarely work perfectly on the first attempt — debugging is key (**16 runs for full success!**)  
- Observability is critical for maintaining microservices at scale  
- Infrastructure-as-code ensures reproducibility, compliance, and easier troubleshooting  
- Analytics layers enable actionable insights and better monitoring of system health  
- Kubernetes orchestration requires attention to detail: **RBAC, naming conventions, manifests, image updates**  
- Cloud cost awareness and resource planning are essential for production readiness  

---

## ✅ Project Status
**Complete** – All infrastructure, microservices, CI/CD pipelines, monitoring, and analytics layers are fully implemented and functional.

## 🔮 Future Improvements
- Add real-time event streaming (**Kinesis** or **Kafka**)  
- Integrate automated vulnerability scanning in CI/CD pipelines  
- Simulate migration scenarios for more cloud experience  
- Implement auto-scaling & resilience testing
